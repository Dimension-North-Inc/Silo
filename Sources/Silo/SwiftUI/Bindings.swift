/// A property wrapper used to mark state properties as accessible via SwiftUI bindings,
///
/// Mark state properties you wish to mutate via SwiftUI bindings with the `@Bound`
/// property wrapper:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct User: Reducer {
///     struct State: States {
///         // accessible as `@Binding`
///         @Bound var name: String
///         @Bound var age:  Int
///
///         // not accessible as `@Binding`
///         var isAuthenticated: Bool
///     }
/// ```
///
/// Next, declare your `Action` type as conforming to `BindingActions`, so that
/// binding updates can be interpreted by your reducer.
/// `BindingActions` replaces multiple, per-property update-style actions with a single
/// action that transports SwiftUI binding updates:
///
///```swift
///     // conform `Action` to `BindingActions`
///     enum Action: BindingActions {
///         case authenticate
///
///         // action used to contain binding update actions
///         case binding(BindingAction<State>)
///     }
///```
///
/// Finally,  ensure your reducer body incorprates a `ReduceBindings` in its implementation.
/// `ReduceBindings` interprets and reduces `binding(BindingAction<State>)` actions:
///
/// ```swift
///     var body: some Reducer<State, Action> {
///         // reduce bindings...
///         ReduceBindings()
///
///         // ...then perform other reducer-specific behavior
///         Reduce {
///             state, action in
///             switch action {
///             case .authenticate:
///                 // ...
///         }
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Once this is done, create view bindings using the usual `$property` syntax:
///
/// ```swift
///     @Observable var user: Store<User>
///     ...
///
///     var body: some View {
///         Form {
///             TextField("Username", value: user.$name
///             ...
/// ```
