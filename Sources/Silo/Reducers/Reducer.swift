///
/// Actions represent both user interactions as well as points in an application's lifecycle.
/// A user's button tap which adds a TODO item to a list of TODOs can be modeled as an action.
/// Similarly, application launch, a ticking timer, or the presentation of a new window can be
/// modeled as actions.
///
/// ```swift
/// enum TickerAction: Actions {
///     case tick // a tick
///     case stopTicking // stop ticking
///     case startTicking(timer: String) // start ticking
/// }
/// ```

/// `State` and return optional asynchronous `Action` generating `Effect`s as result of the
/// `Action`s they receive:
